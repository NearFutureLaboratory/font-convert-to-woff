## Font Converter

Converts most kinds of ttf and otf fonts to woff2 for better use online.

Set up config.json to point to a folder containing fonts and fontConverter.py will recursively burrow about and convert every ttf or otf font it finds and put a woff2 font beside it.

Improvements could be such things as putting them in a parallel folder so you don't have to weed through and gather them up and such things like that.

Anyway.
